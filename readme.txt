Acoustic Soundboard is a program for Windows built with the DearImGui and miniaudio libraries. There is no installation required, simply unzip the contents of this folder wherever you like. This soundboard strives to be an easy to use, lightweight program that can play audio files to others while allowing the user to hear what ia played and still use their microphone normally. To achieve this, you will first need to install a virtual audio cable such as this one:

  1. Once that's done, launch AcousticSoundboard and click "Select Playback Device" and select: 
	a. the device where YOU want to hear the sound 
	b. the virtual device (eg virtual audio cable input)
  2. Next, click "Select Recording Device" and select your microphone.Then, in the same window, select device b from 	step 1. This is the device where your microphone's audio will be sent.
  3. Select a sound file. Most common file formats are supported.
  4. Set a hotkey that will trigger the sound. You can use SHIFT, CONTROL, or ALT key combos, and you can set up to 50 	hotkeys and sounds.
  5. Press your hotkey. Have fun!

When you are finished, close the window. You do not need to close the devices first. Your settings will be saved. With this setup, you should be able to select the virtual audio cable as your microphone in your voice call program of choice, and others should hear your voice through your microphone and the sounds you play. If your program does not allow you to select a microphone, you may have to set the virtual audio cable as your default recording (input) device in Windows.

IMPORTANT: If your hotkeys do not work inside another program, try running Acoustic Soundboard as administrator. This is due to a Windows security feature (integrity levels). In general, you should avoid running programs as administrator, but since Acoustic Soundboard is open source, you can verify that it is safe to use and compile it yourself.
